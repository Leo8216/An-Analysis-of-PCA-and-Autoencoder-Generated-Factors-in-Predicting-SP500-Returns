# predicting_sp500_returns_with_autoencoders
Abstract: The S&amp;P500 is difficult to predict.  Multi-factor models provide a useful framework for making returns predictions and for controlling portfolio risk.  This paper explores a three-step process in predicting PCA and Autoencoders factors to generate multi-factor models from the S&amp;P500 component securities.
